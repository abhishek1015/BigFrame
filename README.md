BigFrame
========

BigFrame is a benchmark generator for big data analytics, which means that it can instantiate different kinds of benchmarks.
Unlike the exsiting benchmarks, e.g TPCDS, HiveBench, etc. which are either micro-benchmarks or benchmarks in 
very specific domains, making them not fit into the big data enviroment taday, BigFrame can instead generate the 
bechmark tailored to a specific set of data and workload requirements.
 
For example, some enterprises may be grappling with increasing data volumes; with the variety and velocity of their 
data not being pressing concerns. Some other enterprises may be interested in benchmarking systems that can handle 
larger volumes and variety of data; but with the volume of unstructured data dominating that of the structured data 
by orders of magnitude. A third category of enterprises may be interested in understanding reference architectures 
for data analytics applications that need to deal with large rates of streaming data (i.e., large velocity of data).

Building
--------

To build BigFrame, run following commands from BigFrame home directory

1. `sbt/sbt compile`
2. `sbt/sbt package`
3. `sbt/sbt assembly`

BigFrame requires:
* JDK 1.6 is needed, JDK 1.7 is recommended.
* Hadoop 1.0.4 (other versions are not tested)
* Spark 0.7.3



Configuration
--------

`/launcher/conf` directory contains following configuration files:

1. `bigframe-core.xml` : Specification of benchmark goes here. 
2. `config.sh` : A set of parameters required for data generation.
3. `spark-env.sh` : A set of parameters required for Spark execution.

Data Generation
--------

Use command `./launcher/bin/datagen` to generate the data you need.


Spark Workflow
--------

Run `./launcher/bin/run` without any arguments. The command usage will be printed out.

Three workflows are supported at present:

1. "Relational only": It runs a query to find out total sales of products within each promotion.
2. "Text only": It runs a script to find out sentiment values for certain products by summing over all available tweets.
3. "Mixed": It runs a workflow involving relational, text and graph processing to generate a report specifying total sales and average sentiment for products that are promoted.
