BigFrame
========

BigFrame is a benchmark generator for big data analytics. 
Unlike the exsiting benchmark, e.g TPCDS, HiveBench, etc. which are either micro-benchmark or benchmark in a 
very specific domain, and they are not fit into the big data enviroment taday, BigFrame is a benchmarking framework 
that can instantiate different benchmarks.

Each benchmark instantiated by the framework would be tailored to a specific set of data and workload requirements. 
For example, some enterprises may be grappling with increasing data volumes; with the variety and velocity of their 
data not being pressing concerns. Some other enterprises may be interested in benchmarking systems that can handle 
larger volumes and variety of data; but with the volume of unstructured data dominating that of the structured data 
by orders of magnitude. A third category of enterprises may be interested in understanding reference architectures 
for data analytics applications that need to deal with large rates of streaming data (i.e., large velocity of data).

Building
--------

Currently, BigFrame uses ant builder. To build BigFrame, just run ant at the root directory.  

BigFrame requires:
* JDK 1.6 is needed, JDK 1.7 is recommended.
* Hadoop 1.0.4 (other versions are not tested)


Configuration
--------

Before running BigFrame, you need to edit the `conf/config.sh` to set the following variables:
* `HADOOP_HOME`: By default, it tries to get it from the environment variables.
* `TPCDS_LOCAL`: A temp directory to store the imtermediate data for tpcds generator. 

Bechmark Specification:
--------
To customize the benchmark you want to generate, you can change the propoerties inside the `conf/bigframe-core.xml`.


Run
--------
Use command `./bin/datagen` to generate the data you need.
